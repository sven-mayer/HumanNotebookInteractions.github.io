						<h3>Explainability in JupyterLab and Beyond: Interactive XAI Systems for Integrated and Collaborative Workflows</h3>
						<h4 id="thin">Grace Guo, Dustin Arendt, and Alex Endert</h4>
						<p>
							Explainable AI (XAI) tools represent a turn to more human-centered and human-in-the-loop AI approaches that emphasize user needs
							and perspectives in machine learning model development workflows. However, while the majority of ML resources available today are
							developed for Python computational environments such as JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook, the same has not been true of interactive
							XAI systems, which are often still implemented as standalone interfaces. In this paper, we address this mismatch by identifying three
							design patterns for embedding front-end XAI interfaces into Jupyter, namely: 1) One-way communication from Python to JavaScript,
							2) Two-way data synchronization, and 3) Bi-directional callbacks. We also provide an open-source toolkit, bonXAI, that demonstrates
							how each design pattern might be used to build interactive XAI tools for a Pytorch text classification workflow. Finally, we conclude
							with a discussion of best practices and open questions. Our aims for this paper are to discuss how interactive XAI tools might be
							developed for computational notebooks, and how they can better integrate into existing model development workflows to support
							more collaborative, human-centered AI.

						<h3>Facilitating Mixed-Methods Analysis with Computational Notebooks</h3>
						<h4 id="thin">Jiawen Stefanie Zhu*, Zibo Zhang*, and Jian Zhao</h4>
						<p>
							Data exploration is an important aspect of the workflow of mixed-methods researchers, who conduct both qualitative and quantitative
							analysis. However, there currently exists few tools that adequately support both types of analysis simultaneously, forcing researchers
							to context-switch between different tools and increasing their mental burden when integrating the results. To address this gap, we
							propose a unified environment that facilitates mixed-methods analysis in a computational notebook-based settings. We conduct a
							scenario study with three HCI mixed-methods researchers to gather feedback on our design concept and to understand our users’
							needs and requirements.

						<h3>Towards Accessible, Flexible and Collaborative Scientific Modeling with Terarium</h3>
						<h4 id="thin">Pascale Proulx et al.</h4>
						<p>
							In the evolving field of scientific modeling research, computational notebooks like Jupyter [7] and Mathematica [13] have made
							steps to promote collaboration by providing interactive environments for code execution, visualization, and narrative composition;
							however they are still limited. For instance issues exist in supporting nonlinear workflows, scalability, and reproducibility leading
							to significant barriers in reusing work. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Terarium, a platform that attempts to socialize
							scientific modeling for a broad audience, including students, researchers, and data scientists. Terarium is designed to support nonlinear
							workflows, cater to varying expertise levels, and promote collaboration. Its workflow editor enables users to connect notebooks
							focused on specific modeling and simulation tasks, along with modeling assets, in flexible, branching workflows. Users can utilize
							dual-modality workflow nodes — a wizard and notebook view — to perform core operations with potentially less effort and gain
							insights into how to use the underlying code libraries to go further. Additionally, the AI-assistance should support users with a range of
							programming experience. By focusing on accessibility, flexibility, and code transparency, Terarium aims to address current challenges
							and foster a collaborative scientific modeling environment, enriching the dialogue on computational modeling tool development.

						<h3>KiwiNotebook: Interactive Computational Notebook Enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Language Models</h3>
						<h4 id="thin">Mohamed Hendy∗, Arghya Sarkar∗, Utku Ege Tuluk, Yicheng Jiang, Xin Teng, and Hongyi Wen</h4>
						<p>
							Computational notebooks have become integral in Data Science workflows and thus increasingly extended into educational settings for
							enhanced interaction between students and Data Science materials. While previous studies highlighted the benefits of incorporating
							notebooks for mutual engagements, the emergence of AI technologies necessitates exploring the potential integration of Large
							Language Models (LLMs) into computational notebooks to enhance Data Science education. This paper introduces KiwiNotebook,
							a novel framework that integrates Data Science course slides with Retrieval-Augmented Language Models to seamlessly enhance
							computational notebooks’ interactivity. KiwiNotebook enables students to interact with class slides, run code, and ask clarifying
							questions through a Chat Assistant interface. The architecture emphasizes real-time student-slide interactions, facilitating a step-bystep
							teaching-learning approach within the notebook environment. Comparative experiments between KiwiNotebook and the OpenAI API 
							highlighted KiwiNotebook’s personalized responses tailored to class slides and emphasized step-by-step guidance and interactive
							coding support.

						<h3>From Computational to Conversational Notebooks</h3>
						<h4 id="thin">Thomas Weber and Sven Mayer</h4>
						<p>
							Today, we see a drastic increase in LLM-based user interfaces to support users in various tasks. Also, in programming, we witness
							a productivity boost with features like LLM-supported code completion and conversational agents to generate code. In this work,
							we look at the future of computational notebooks by enriching them with LLM support. We propose a spectrum of support, from
							simple inline code completion to executable code that was the output of a conversation. We showcase five concrete examples for
							potential user interface designs and discuss their benefits and drawbacks. With this, we hope to inspire the future development of
							LLM-supported computational notebooks.

						<h3>Untangling Knots: Leveraging LLM for Error Resolution in Computational Notebooks</h3>
						<h4 id="thin">Konstantin Grotov*, Sergey Titov*, Yaroslav Zharov, and Timofey Bryksin</h4>
						<p>
							Computational notebooks became indispensable tools for research-related development, offering unprecedented interactivity and
							flexibility in the development process. However, these benefits come at the cost of reproducibility and an increased potential for bugs.
							There are many tools for bug fixing; however, they are generally targeted at the classical linear code. With the rise of code-fluent Large
							Language Models, a new stream of smart bug-fixing tools has emerged. However, the applicability of those tools is still problematic for
							non-linear computational notebooks. In this paper, we propose a potential solution for resolving errors in computational notebooks via
							an iterative LLM-based agent. We discuss the questions raised by this approach and share a novel dataset of computational notebooks
							containing bugs to facilitate the research of the proposed approach.

						<h3>Output-Oriented Notebooks: Facilitating Rapid Exploration while Supporting Reproducibility</h3>
						<h4 id="thin">David Koop and Colin J. Brown</h4>
						<p>
							Computational notebooks have a number of features, including support for rapid exploration and editing, that have led to their
							adoption in a variety of fields. Notebooks combine text, code, and rich, often interactive, outputs in a single medium. They allow users
							to split code into cells, each of which can have a corresponding output, and these outputs often serve as the inspiration for the next
							step in an analysis. In most programming environments, variable names help users connect outputs from one expression to their use
							in others, but in notebook cells, the connection between the displayed output and the underlying variable can be unclear. We use
							named outputs and a dataflow structure to clearly link cells, improving comprehension and structuring the computation so that it can
							be more reproducible. This supports reuse by reducing ambiguity and mental strain when exploring and reviewing notebooks.

						<h3>Modeling the Dashboard Provenance</h3>
						<h4 id="thin"> Johne Jarske, Jorge Rady, Lucia V. L. Filgueiras, Leandro M. Velloso, Tania L.
							Santos</h5>
							<p>
								Organizations of all kinds, whether public or private, profit-driven or non-profit, and
								across various industries and sectors,
								rely on dashboards for effective data visualization. However, the reliability and
								efficacy
								of these dashboards depend on the quality of
								the data they present. Studies show that less than a quarter of dashboards provide
								information about their sources, which is just one of
								the expected metadata when provenance is seriously considered. This paper aims to
								provide a
								provenance representation model specifically
								designed for dashboards that entitles standardization, modeling, generation, capture,
								and
								visualization. The proposed model will offer a
								comprehensive set of essential provenance metadata that enables users to evaluate the
								quality, consistency, and reliability of the information
								on the dashboards. This will allow a clear and precise understanding of the context in
								which
								a specific dashboard was developed, ultimately leading to better decision-making.

						<h3>Visualising category recoding and redistributions</h3>
						<h4 id="thin"> Cynthia A Huang</h4>
						<p>
							This paper proposes graphical representations of data and rationale provenance in workflows
							that convert data between distinct but semantically related nomenclature. We motivate the
							graphical representations with a new task abstraction, the Nomenclature Transformation, and
							associated graph-based information structure, the Crossmap. The structure is illustrated
							using an example of converting numeric statistics from a country-specific nomenclature to an
							international classification standard, a common task in ex-post data harmonisation.
							Crossmaps support the separation of domain expertise and categorical mapping decisions from
							the specifics of data manipulation. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of using
							visualisation to audit and communicate nomenclature transformations and present candidate
							graphical representations.
